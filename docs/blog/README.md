  **Misconfiguration of Ethereum RPC Series 2: Unlimited Batch Requests**

  <span style="color:green;">Label:</span> <span style="color:red;">Multiple Venders Affected</span>

  Ethereum-based L2 implementations lack limits on batch request size or number, making nodes vulnerable to memory exhaustion and crashes. Several leading projects, such as Polygon zkEVM and Scroll, are affected by this vulnerability.

  **Double-Spending Vulnerabilities on Arbitrum**

  <span style="color:green;">Label:</span> <span style="color:red;">Critical Impact, Complex Bug</span>

  In 2022, I started to study the Arbitrum codebase and found several critical double-spending vulnerabilities. These double-spending vulnerabilities could cause billions of dollars in direct losses to third-party cross-chain bridges and centralized exchanges. Arbiturm fixed these vulnerabilities in a timely manner and gave me huge bug bounties.

  **Security Analysis of Algorand Smart Contracts**

  While reviewing the Algorand ecosystem, I identified several generic vulnerabilities within Algorand smart contracts, stemming from incorrect programming practices. I developed a static analysis tool to automatically find these bugs, and conducted a comprehensive vulnerability scan of Algorandâ€™s blockchain. Many projects, including key blockchain platforms like decentralized exchanges and NFT auction systems, have acknowledged the vulnerabilities found by my tool. I also received bug bounties from some projects.
